# Personal site portfloio
## [dhia-gharsallaoui.github.io](https://dhia-gharsallaoui.github.io/)
I build this personal portfolio using those two essentials tools:

### [HUGO:](https://gohugo.io/)

Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in Go. It is optimized for speed, ease of use, and configurability. Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website.

### [Hugo-profile:](https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile)

A template of portfolio using Hugo.
